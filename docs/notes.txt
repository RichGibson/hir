Early mezzanine notes

-mkdir templates/ put index.html and whatever in there.

Default templates for our install:
/usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/mezzanine/core/templates/

Copy those templates to project templates to replace them.

There is a command which will copy all of the templates, but I'm
not sure yet if that is a good idea. For now I think one at a time.
tried doing it, not sure it is working :-/ rather, which tmeplate is being used.

http://mezzanine.jupo.org/docs/frequently-asked-questions.html#where-are-all-the-templates-i-can-modify


 python manage.py collecttemplates --help

Adding/Editing a page type:
edit models.py, see current example.

Now working on residency and space models. in sqlite3 drop the current
tables:
(sqlite can't do migrations, but it is easy to use rather then postgres
or mysql for now)
sqlite> drop table hir_residency;
sqlite> drop table hir_space;


python ./manage.py schemamigration hir --initial
python ./manage.py migrate hir


ugh...
to recreate the database:
python manage.py createdb --noinput

...
I reran mezzanine-project hir
-add hir to installed apps.
uncomment mezzanine.accounts from installed pps

python ./manage.py createsuperuser



Add to github
1. create repository on git hub
2. mv current hir to hir_temp
3. clone
sudo git clone git://github.com/RichGibson/hir.git
4. sudo chown -R richgibson:richgibson hir
5. copy things back from hir_temp
6.
