Right now:
Sat 11:18

Status:  Add your organization goes into hir_organization.


Issue:
-successful add of an organization doesn't return to a reasonable place.
but it does add...so just live with it?

1. Make list organizations work
fuck. It does work right now on my machine. push code and pray?
2. Move hir_organization to a Models.model, move the page_processor code to a view, change
the urls.py , move add-organization from templates/pages to pages probably
3. add user_id to hir_organization


.....
Why don't my orgizations show up on my local machine?
Do they show up on pistonbot?

Mezzanine page processors make my head hurt a lot.
They appear to be silently ignored at (random?) times.

Now my add your organization form is being ignored. WTF?

I need to strip this out

-"we need to get this going because the Bejeing people have been on hold"

-get it running on home machine and pistonbot
-why don't orgs show?
-think about moving out of the 'page' framework, it is too freaking annoying.





Wed Mar 5:
-create organization form
-clean up organization form
-push public
-send mitch an email
-create residency form
-clean up residency form
-extend tests

issue : add an organization not calling the page_processor.
add a residency is. WTF?
Answer: mezzanine has some issues :-/ Changed slug of 'organization' page
to 'add-organization' and life is better.

Now: list of organizations is failing.
And add-organization is not displaying title.
print >>sys.stderr, in various page_processor places are not being
calle consistenty. Ie. the dang page_processor code is only sometimes
being called.

Answer: set Debug=True in settings. Mezzanine silently 
ignores errors in the page_processor. Fuck that is annoying.

This is just so annoying. I make changes to code, but they are not
actually run - some default behavior gets run and it is unclear why
or when.







Now:
fixed-do wording changes
fixed-why do 144.77.17.54:8000 and pistonbot.com:8000 look different?
fixed --pistonbot has the side bars with add org/residencie.
-How to show formdata on a page:
fixed-show list of orgs
fixed-show list of residencies


This has some tricks:
https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/mezzanine-users/FvCUK9k1NRM

This works:
single_form = Form.objects.get(slug="organizationspace")
formentry_list=FormEntry.objects.filter(form_id=single_form.id)
label_list = [ ]
field_list = Field.objects.filter(form_id=single_form.id)

look at test.py:wq



this does?
single_form = Form.objects.all()

This works
pages=Page.objects.all()

? I have different tables? WTF?

I have different pages between pistonbot.com:8000 and 144.77.17.54:8000

http://144.76.17.54:8000/admin/pages/page/
http://pistonbot.com:8000/admin/pages/page/

looking at log they both appear as requests with the same details except
for the size of /admin/pages/page. 

pages_page has a site_id. ah. Activated when I added pistonbot.com site.
ugh!!!

now I have a superset, a mess really.



Early mezzanine notes

-mkdir templates/ put index.html and whatever in there.

Default templates for our install on ubunto:

/usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/mezzanine/core/templates/
and on osx
/Library/Python/2.7/site-packages/mezzanine/core/templates

Copy those templates to project templates to replace them.

There is a command which will copy all of the templates, but I'm
not sure yet if that is a good idea. For now I think one at a time.
tried doing it, not sure it is working :-/ rather, which tmeplate is being used.

http://mezzanine.jupo.org/docs/frequently-asked-questions.html#where-are-all-the-templates-i-can-modify


 python manage.py collecttemplates --help

Adding/Editing a page type:
edit models.py, see current example.

Now working on residency and space models. in sqlite3 drop the current
tables:
(sqlite can't do migrations, but it is easy to use rather then postgres
or mysql for now)
sqlite> drop table hir_residency;
sqlite> drop table hir_space;

South  migrations: this creates the initial migration.
python ./manage.py schemamigration hir --initial
python ./manage.py migrate hir

After the initial migration do this:
python ./manage.py schemamigration hir --auto 
python ./manage.py migrate hir

ugh...
to recreate the database:
Don't do this lightly!
python manage.py createdb --noinput

...
I reran mezzanine-project hir
-add hir to installed apps.
uncomment mezzanine.accounts from installed pps

python ./manage.py createsuperuser



Add to github
1. create repository on git hub
2. mv current hir to hir_temp
3. clone
sudo git clone git://github.com/RichGibson/hir.git
4. sudo chown -R richgibson:richgibson hir
5. copy things back from hir_temp
6.  git remote set-url origin git@github.com:RichGibson/hir.git


...
Copy it to run on my laptop. 
I had to do this:
touch __init__.py
Where is an init.py? Confused, oh well.

....
Adding extra fields to a Form

# Allow extra fields types to be defined via the FORMS_EXTRA_FIELDS
# setting, which should contain a sequence of three-item sequences,
# each containing the ID, dotted import path for the field class,
# and field name, for each custom field type.
# You get to make up the ID, but it can't conflict with 'CLASSES;
# so pick well :-/
# see mezzanine/forms/fields.py for the code where this setting isÂ·
# defined

in settings.py
FORMS_EXTRA_FIELDS= [ [42,'extra_fields.py','LABEL']]

Look at 
/usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/django/forms/fields.py for examples of the 
'field_class'
....
Change name of page slug:
update pages_page set slug='organization' where slug='organizationspace';

...........................................
Change wording of login/signup block.
1. Where is it?

Inspect element in browser, it is class="panel... look for that in 
base.html.
might be includes/user_panel.html


....
Deployment notes
/etc/apache2/sites-available/hir.conf (started with a skeleton of an existing site)

python ./manage.py collectstatic
edit wsgi.py
sudo a2ensite hir.conf 
yay internal server error.
That means something is happening.

And then dork with a sys.path.append in settings, which seems unneeded/wrong, but works :-/
-set DEBUG to false
django_site - seems like it should be www.hackerinresidence.org, but then my pages don't show up :-/

.....
for test fixtures to work.
pip install pyyaml

to make my fixture: 
python ./manage.py dumpdata hir --format=yaml --indent=4 > fixtures/hir.yaml

This copies everything in the database, might matter for some things to have this
python ./manage.py dumpdata  --format=yaml --indent=4 > fixtures/all.yaml

....
Testing/fixture 'fun'
This works
python ./manage.py loaddata fixtures/hir.json 

But having fixtures = ['hir.json'] in my test class doesn't work.
....
Testing Client

In [1]: from django.test.client import Client
In [2]: c = Client()
In [3]: response=c.get('/list-of-residencies/')
In [6]: response.status_code
