Try to understand the models

Mezzanine forms don't have a slug.

Can I monkey patch Forms field?
mezzanine.forms.models.Field

Fuck it, try it.
It probably will work, but I don't yet have it. oh well.

What to I want?
to map the contents of a form to a dictionary keyed 
on something I can use.

ie. slugs :-/

so FieldSlug model?
id, fieldID, slug
